# ARGH - A Rhythm Game Helper (obviously not the final title) 
is a Discord bot I'm working on, currently has a fully implemented Cytus II song search feature using data scraped from https://ct2view.the-kitti.com/chartlist.html.

### Planned features:
- OCR for calculating the number of white perfects from Cytus 2 screenshots

### Current dependencies:
- BeautifulSoup
- discord.py
- fuzzywuzzy
- pandas
- pykakasi
- numpy

### Special thanks:
